# README
This is my submission for the Change++ 2020 Coding Challenge. It has a React frontend and a Golang backend. Each game consists of 5 rounds, user stats are displayed at the end of each round.

## Why did I choose these tools?
When I approached the challenge I wanted to make something that looked good, was intuitive to use, and would demonstrate my proficiency in some of the tools I mentioned in my original application. 

## Where could I have improved?
1. Definitely could have written more tests for this. This is something that I generally would have done but it was also midterms. 
2. Another thing I could have done was checking twitter handle input better. I just let the program hard fail if the user entered an invalid twitter handle or if the twitter handle had no associated tweets. 
3. Git branches could have been used.


## Running the frontend
Open a terminal window, make sure you are in the Front End directory, then install the node modules and run `npm start`.


## Running the backend
Open a terminal window, make sure you have Go installed in your system, run `go run main.go` after you are in the Back End directory.
